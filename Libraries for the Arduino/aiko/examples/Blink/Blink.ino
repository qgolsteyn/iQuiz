/*
 * Blink
 *
 * An "Aiko-ised" version of the basic Arduino example.  Turns on an
 * LED on for one second, then off for one second, and so on...  We
 * use pin 13 because, depending on your Arduino board, it has either a
 * built-in LED or a built-in resistor so that you need only an LED.
 *
 * The difference between this version and the original "Blink" is that
 * using Aiko allows the blink function to be called at a specified
 * interval and return immediately rather than using delay and blocking
 * the execution of other code in the sketch.
