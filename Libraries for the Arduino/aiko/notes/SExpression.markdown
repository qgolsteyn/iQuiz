Aiko SExpression Module
=======================

    #include <AikoSExpression.h>

S-expressions give you a simple way to pass structured data between the Arduino
and other devices. Think of them as the Arduino equivalent of JSON.

A good example is the case where you want to send commands to your Arduino over
the serial console.


Goals
-----

- Easily human readable and writable
- Easy machine parsing
    - Minimal memory overhead
    - Lazy parsing
- Implementation on many platforms
    - Good tests to facilitate this
- Simple translation to/from JSON
- Simple mapping to/from XML
